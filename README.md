# *Neural Network Building Blocks* - 2025 Deep Learning School "Basic Concepts" 

Hello and welcome to the *Neural Network Building Blocks* repository for the 2025 Deep Learning School "Basic Concepts"!

## Session Goals
* Give context to the development of deep learning, and its importance in modern physical sciences.
* Introduce some traditional simpler "machine learning" techniques.
* Provide an introduction to the `PyTorch` ML framework.
* Explain the basis building blocks of deep neural networks

  ## Interactive Elements
  1. Practice using `PyTorch` tensors
  2. Simple linear regression
  3. Binary classification through logistic regression
  4. Applying neural networks to tasks 2 and 3
  5. Building a small DNN to identify the Higgs boson in LHC data!

## About Me
My name is Ethan. I worked as a post-doc at the University of Manchester, as part of the ATLAS Collaboration at CERN.
My work and interests involve measuring a particle called the top quark which is produced at the Large Hadron Collider, and refining the techniques we use to reconstruct and identify objects called "jets", which are also produced at the LHC.
I am part of teams using machine learning for both of these tasks.
