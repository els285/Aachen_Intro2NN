# *Neural Network Building Blocks* - 2025 Deep Learning School "Basic Concepts" 

Hello and welcome to the *Neural Network Building Blocks* repository for the 2025 Deep Learning School "Basic Concepts"!

## About Me
My name is Ethan. I worked as a post-doc at the University of Manchester, as part of the ATLAS Collaboration at CERN.
My work and interests involve measuring a particle called the top quark which is produced at the Large Hadron Collider, and refining the techniques we use to reconstruct and identify objects called "jets", which are also produced at the LHC.
I am part of teams using machine learning for both of these tasks.
